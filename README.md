# Cult of the Skull - Warframe Dojo
This repository contains the JSON definition for the 
Dojo Plans to be used in https://dojoplanner.stom66.co.uk/

The plans are splitted into stages. With labels for expected 
power levels as each room is built. Exact room definition for
gardens is not really defined. Whoever adds it can just choose
the type.

Resources contributed to a room are never lost. If we ever decide
to change the layout, rooms do need to be destroyed and replaced
so it could lead to a lot of time wasted.

# Stages

Currently, there are 5 stages defined:

## 1st Stage - Base Reactor

Start building the base reactor needed for more rooms, and also a
connector allowing us to branch into different sectors

## 2nd Stage - Main Layout

Define the main layout of the dojo so that rooms can be placed
in the future. The idea I originally had was to have a first level
that would contain the laboratories (where the starter hall is)
and have an elevator that brings us upstairs to other rooms.

This stage should establish:
- 2 small gardens
- 1 elevator
- 1 big garden

## 3rd Stage - Laboratories, part 1

This stage starts the first branch of laboratories on the main level.
The first room to build is the Oracle, followed by the Bio and Chem
labs along with its connectors.

The stage ends with a new reactor on the 2nd floor and a connector to
add more reactors later.

## 4th Stage - Final Laboratories expansion

This stage finishes establishing all laboratories. But for this we
are going to start running short on room capacity, so we should build
a Great Hall to increase that.
After that, we build the Energy, Orokin and Tenno labs, finishing with
a reactor and an extra connector for later usage

## 5th Stage - Future expansions

At this point, i don't know what else to put there. We should think
about building a dueling room, a temple of honor, observatory and
obstacle course.
Probably we'll need to add some extra reactors or clan halls as capacities
run low.

# Decorations

Decorations are not really defined. We can start placing those that allow
us to increase the clan's rank.
